          <div class="body-text">Game Design project where I made a 2D tower defense game. The player starts with
            100 currency and can place down walls and/or cannons to defend their base from incoming waves of enemies.
            The game starts in a build phase where the tilemap is shown and the player can add or remove walls or cannons.
            Then when the player starts the round, the game is switched to a normal view of the battlefield and enemies are spawned in
            and approach the player's base to destroy it. 
          </div>
          <div class="body-text">Every frame runs Dijkstra's Algorithm and enemies index into their tile to view the optimal pathing.
            When the player places walls, each tier of wall has a health value and a defense value. Each tile in Dijkstra's Algorithm
            costs 1 movement, the defense value of a wall or cannon increases the movement cost meaning that enemies will pathfind to
            go around walls or to the weakest link in the walls. If an enemy is attacking a wall, its health decreases lowering its
            defense value so that other enemies will also target this new weakness and eventually destroy the wall or obstacle.
