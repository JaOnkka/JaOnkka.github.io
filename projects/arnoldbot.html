        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">For my Software Engineering class I worked in a team of 6 students to build a multi-feature Discord bot.
            We each focused on making our own features of the bot and worked together using Kanban and Agile strategies along with
            feature branching for our Git workflow. 
          </div>
          <div class="body-text">My feature of the bot was for letting users play a game of Jeopardy within their text channels.
            Users have the choice between starting a solo game or a multiplayer game to compete with their friends. For solo games,
            the user can choose how many categories they want to play with which would let them choose the "length" of the game.
            In solo play, the user is also given hints if they get the answer wrong, each failed attempt would reveal more letters of
            the correct answer similar to Wheel of Fortune. 
          </div>
          <div class="body-text">In multiplayer games the host would run the command to start a lobby, where other players can 
            click to join the lobby, once the timer ends the game is formed with all the players that entered the lobby. The gameplay
            here is much more similar to the TV show where the first player to buzz in goes. The scores at the end of the game are tracked
            for the user account inside a database so users can keep track of their total winnings.
          </div>
          <div class="body-text">When each game is queued up, the bot will create an id for the game and add players to it
            and make a database for the questions which get pulled from a massive collection of Jeopardy questions from over 30 years.
            So each game randomly picks however many categories, then picks the 5 questions for each of those categories.
