          <div class="body-text">This is a Capstone project for building a search app for English students at various universities to search
            for Technical Communication articles for their research. The project's sponsor, Avon Murphy, is a prolific Technical Communication
            researcher himself and collaborated with WSUV to have two CS Capstone teams build this app.
          </div>
          <div class="body-text">The first year's team had built the framework of the app and laid the foundation of the tech stack
            needed for the front end and back end. My team then took on this project and first had to read through and understand
            how the project worked based off of the code and documentation left behind. Aferwards we had begun development and finished
            the app working closely with our sponsor Avon to make sure the app worked and suited the needs of our target audience.
          </div>
          <div class="body-text">My team and I managed to deploy the app onto WSUV servers working with the IT admin on campus which allowed
            all students/faculty to use the app while on the network. Individually, I was responsible for the backend handling of the database
            and functionality of searching for articles. The project's database comes from hand picked articles from our sponsor and we build
            these entries into a database for indexing and searching using Apache Lucene and Hibernate.
          </div>

          <div class="body-text">Now I am currently working on this project as an independent contractor. Feel free to check out the site for yourself at <a href="https://tcbib.org/">https://tcbib.org</a></div>
